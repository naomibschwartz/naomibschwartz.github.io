abstract: Despite the prevalence of fire in continental Southeast Asia and its important ecological role, little is known about the drivers of geographical and interannual variation of fire activity in the region. Fire regimes are shaped by precipitation, where factors such as variation in total rainfall and rainfall seasonality create dry conditions that promote fire. Moreover, landcover type and anthropogenic land use also influence the fire regime. However, research on how precipitation drives fire regimes in different land use and landcover types in continental Southeast Asia is understudied. Here, we examined how rainfall influences fire activity using remote sensing data from 2001 to 2021. Our research investigated 1) how fire regimes vary across continental Southeast Asia, including how this variation relates to climate, and 2) how interannual variation in fire activity relates to weather variability. We used MODIS data to quantify fire size, frequency, and intensity and CHIRPS to quantify mean annual precipitation, the mean yearly maximum climatological water deficit, dry season length, and a seasonality index. Our results found that as annual precipitation increased, fire frequency and intensity decreased in savanna and woody vegetation. We found that drier regions experienced high fire frequency coupled with low fire intensity. Furthermore, low fire frequency and high fire intensity were identified in areas with stand-replacing forest loss. Our research indicates that landcover type, land use, and precipitation conditions influenced fire activity. Exploring how fire responds to climate is key to understanding and forecasting changes in Southeast Asian ecosystems.
