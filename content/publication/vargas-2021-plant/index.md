abstract: 'Plant hydraulics are a powerful tool to explain variation in species responses to extreme drought events and have improved the power of vegetation dynamics models. Because tropical species distributions may reflect their drought sensitivity during drought events, we hypothesized that plant hydraulic traits are correlated with the rainfall characteristics of species geographical ranges (rainfall niche). To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pan-tropical data synthesis of two plant hydraulic traits that describe the threshold of leaf physiological function in response to water stress, turgor loss point (TLP), and the water potential at 50% xylem embolism due to drought stress (P50). With data on ~1100 tropical plant species from 135 families, we answered three questions: 1) where are the gaps of knowledge on plant hydraulics in the tropics? 2) how do plant hydraulic traits vary as a function of rainfall characteristics of the sampling site? 3) to what extent do plant hydraulic traits explain species rainfall niches across tropical biomes? Our data set shows great representation of species from the Neotropical and Indo-Malay realms, with few samples of Afrotropical species. In most cases species were sampled in fewer than three locations with distinct rainfall regimes. TLP tended to be higher in wetter and less seasonal sites, which contrasts with the weak relationship between P50 values and site rainfall regime. The latter pattern was caused by large variance in P50 in dry sites. For both traits, species that were associated with long dry seasons (> six months) showed high drought tolerance (more negative TLP and P50). However, species with high P50 had an intermediate seasonality niche and species with high TLP had a high mean annual rainfall niche (MARn). Interestingly, we observed a threshold in which species associated with MARn <1500 mm more commonly had a mean TLP < -2.0 Mpa. These results suggest that drivers of TLP and P50 variation in the tropics might differ, and that within-species variability could be key in determining the relationship of plant hydraulics to environmental gradients. More importantly, our data set highlights the need for a greater understanding of tropical plant drought tolerance in regions predicted to face large shifts in precipitation regime under ongoing climate change.'
