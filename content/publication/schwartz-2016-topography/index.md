abstract: 'Changes in the frequency and severity of drought will affect tropical forests via changes in tree growth and mortality, carbon dynamics, and community composition. However, predicting drought responses is challenging because individual trees experience drought differently due to local variation in water availability associated with soil type, fine scale topographic variation, and competition for water. Furthermore, differences in physiology and functional traits affect species responses to drought. These differences underlie observed variation in drought response, yet few studies have investigated the relationship between fine-scale topography, neighborhood crowding, functional traits, and drought impacts. In this study, we aimed to understand: how does drought affect tree growth, and does this effect change with topography and neighborhood crowding? Furthermore, how do functional traits modulate the effect of drought and its interaction with topography and crowding? To address these questions, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model that quantified the effects of drought and topography (slope and curvature) on individual tree growth, and the way these effects are modulated by two key traits related to water use: specific leaf area (SLA) and wood density (WD). We fit this model with spatially explicit annual census data, spanning one drought year and one non-drought year, from five second-growth forest plots in Puerto Rico, along with 1 m resolution topography data. We found variable drought response across species, with species with higher WD and lower SLA showing stronger reductions of growth during drought. The effects of slope and curvature also varied across species, with growth of species with lower WD more negatively associated with slope and positively associated with curvature. Contrary to expectations, drought response did not vary strongly with topography. Crowding negatively affected growth for most species, and this effect was amplified during drought years, though the strength of the crowding effect was not associated with either of the traits considered. This study demonstrates how tree census data, functional traits, and fine-scale topography data can be used to improve predictions of forest drought response, ultimately improving representation of tropical forests in ESMs.'
