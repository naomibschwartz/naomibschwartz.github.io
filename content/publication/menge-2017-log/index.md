abstract: Ecologists commonly present data in logarithm-scaled space. Based on our experiences, we hypothesized that data presented in logarithm-scaled space, and particularly with logarithmic values (e.g., -1, 0, 1, instead of 0.1, 1, 10), would mislead readers about the relationships between variables. To test this hypothesis we developed an online survey and, with the help of the ESA office, distributed it to the ESA membership. The survey asked respondents to identify four pieces of information about relationships between two variables, using the example of rabbit and chipmunk populations as a function of distance from the edge of a habitat. Each respondent saw figures and tables from randomly selected datasets and randomly selected scale formats (linear scale and values, logarithmic scale and linear values, or logarithmic scale and values). The four pieces of information were (1) whether a population increased or decreased, (2) which population changed more steeply, (3) the sign (positive, zero, or negative) of the population size at the edge of the habitat, and (4) whether populations changed in an accelerating vs. constant vs. decelerating manner. Over 1000 ecologists responded to the survey.
