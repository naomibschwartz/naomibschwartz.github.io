abstract: Land cover is an essential variable in understanding the global climate and terrestrial carbon cycle. The most common approach to derive land cover information is through the classification of optical satellite images. In complex landscapes, however, land cover types are often inter-confused with those that are spectrally similar but structurally different. For example, discrimination between different forest types and tree plantations may be challenging with spectral information alone. We examined the potential of vertical vegetation structure acquired by the GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation), a space-borne waveform lidar sensor installed on the ISS, to improve land cover maps across a complex seasonally dry tropical landscape in Cambodia. We extracted a range of GEDI metrics from Level-1b and Level-2a data products at over 421 locations across 6 known land cover types across the study area. A set of decision trees were developed to predict land cover based on these structural metrics. Once developed, we applied the model to 79,000 GEDI footprints over the area and compared them to an existing land cover dataset derived from the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.
