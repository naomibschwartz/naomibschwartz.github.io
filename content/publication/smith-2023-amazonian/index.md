abstract: Restoration of tropical landscapes through the expansion of secondary forests
  is crucial for climate change mitigation and offers co-benefits for biodiversity.
  However, the strength of these benefits is influenced by the position of these secondary
  forests within the landscape. Recovery of both carbon stocks and biodiversity in
  secondary forests are enhanced by proximity to old-growth forests, and old-growth
  forests may benefit from secondary forests in return through buffering of edge effects
  and reduced fragmentation. However, to date there has been no biome-wide assessment
  of secondary forest location relative to old-growth forests. We mapped Amazonian
  secondary forests and explored their proximity to old-growth forests of different
  conditions. We then calculated the extent to which secondary forests buffer old-growth
  edge forest (&lt;120 m from an edge) and the influence of secondary forests on fragmentation.
  In 2020, 41.2% of Amazonian secondary forest was directly adjacent to old-growth
  forest and 94.1% was within a fragment connected to old growth. However, adjacency
  and connectedness fell to 20.1% and 57.4% respectively when only considering extensive
  structurally intact old-growth forest. Secondary forests buffered 41.1% of old-growth
  edge forest and, when acting as corridors, reduced the total number of old-growth
  fragments by 2 million. Our results reveal the importance of understanding spatial
  context when examining the potential benefits of increasing secondary forest cover.
  Improved understanding of the benefits of locating secondary forests next to old-growth
  forests could support the development of more effective climate change mitigation
  and restoration strategies.
