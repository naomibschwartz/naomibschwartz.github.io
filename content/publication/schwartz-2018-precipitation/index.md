abstract: Temporal variation in water availability is an important environmental filter in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF), characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. Drought deciduousness is an effective strategy to cope with seasonal water shortages that maximizes carbon gain but avoids dry season water stress. Alternatively, evergreen trees endure seasonal water stress by relying on deep roots and more conservative water use. These contrasting strategies coexist in SDTF, though their relative dominance differs across the biome. While prior studies have assessed the importance of mean annual rainfall and dry season intensity in driving this variation, the global drivers of deciduousness are not well understood. In particular, the timing, contrast, number, and length of wet vs. dry seasons vary across SDTF, as does the magnitude of year-to-year variation in these factors, with likely effects on phenology. Furthermore, the soil template may modulate the relationship between rainfall and phenology through water storage or variation in nutrient availability.

In this study, we used remotely sensed data on phenology across SDTF to ask:

1) How do inter- and intra-annual variability in rainfall affect the degree of deciduousness across global SDTF?

2) How does the soil template modulate the relationship between rainfall and phenology?
