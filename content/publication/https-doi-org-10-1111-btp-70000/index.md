abstract: ABSTRACT In the seasonally dry landscapes of continental Southeast Asia,
  deciduous dipterocarp vegetation (DDF) and semi-evergreen forests (SEF) form patchy
  landscape mosaics, with abrupt boundaries between them. DDF resembles savanna, with
  an open canopy and a continuous grassy ground layer, while SEF lacks grass and has
  high tree cover and a closed canopy. Alternative hypotheses suggest that these distinct
  vegetation types are alternative stable states maintained by fire-vegetation feedbacks,
  that differences in edaphic conditions across landscapes explain their distributions,
  and/or that DDF are degraded or early successional forests whose distribution is
  determined by legacies of anthropogenic disturbance. Here, we compare structure,
  composition, and functional traits of woody vegetation across DDF-SEF boundaries,
  and ask whether differences across vegetation types are associated with edaphic
  factors or fire history. We found major differences in vegetation structure and
  species composition across DDF and SEF, with few shared species across vegetation
  types. Dominant DDF tree species were not found in SEF, suggesting that DDF represents
  a distinct vegetation community, rather than early successional or degraded forest.
  Compared to SEF species, DDF species had lower specific leaf area and higher bark
  thickness, a key trait associated with fire tolerance. Soil texture and fertility
  did not differ across vegetation types. Together, these findings suggest that fire,
  not edaphic factors, likely is the key driver of vegetation at DDF-SEF boundaries.
  Our results further support classifying and managing DDF as savanna. Conserving
  the unique biodiversity of DDF-SEF mosaic landscapes will require research to support
  evidence-based fire management.
