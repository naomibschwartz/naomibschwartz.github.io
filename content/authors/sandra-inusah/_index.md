In the course of Sandraâ€™s studies, she has cultivated a keen interest in land cover changes, human-environment interactions, and the application of geospatial and machine learning technologies in assessing landscape structural changes. Her goal is to incorporate these technologies into research projects to enhance the understanding of landscape-level transformations and identify the key drivers behind them. She enjoys being indoors, watching movies, listening to music, and cooking.
