Sarah completed her MSc in Geography in 2021. Her research focused on understanding the relationship between forest canopy structure and microclimate in burned forests in BC’s interior. She is interested in research that capitalizes on rapidly expanding remote sensing technology to improve management practices. She also enjoys backpacking, running, and spending time outside with family and friends. Sarah will be sticking around UBC as a PhD student in the Coops’ lab in the Faculty of Forestry. Stay tuned for the publication with her results soon!
