Yajie is a new PhD student in the Schwartz Lab. She is interested in the coexistence and dynamics of tree and grass in savannas. Her previous project was to estimate canopy heights in tropical savannas by combining GEDI data with optical and SAR data. She got her BSc and MSc degree in GIS from Nanjing University. In her spare time, she likes to find tasty food, read fiction, and practice guitar.
