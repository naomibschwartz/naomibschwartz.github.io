Daniel's research integrates field observations, fire modelling, and (to a much lesser degree) remote sensing to evaluate ecosystem dynamics in Cambodia's forest mosaic. For his Master's, he will be focusing specifically on the role of fire as a feedback mechanism in open-closed canopy, heterogeneous forest systems, but he is broadly interested in how disturbance, and lack of disturbance, shapes ecologies. Prior to UBC, he spent four years working in various fire management and research roles. He has worked for the US Forest Service, Park Service, BLM, and NGO's to support suppression, prescribed burn, and fire monitoring efforts throughout the US. When he's not clackin' away at a keyboard he likes gingerly mountain biking the North Shore, playing ball sports, and reading fiction.
