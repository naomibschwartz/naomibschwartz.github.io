Lucky's research focuses on the impact of anthropogenic activities on the regeneration and spatial structure of tropical and temperate forest ecosystems and the implications for key ecosystem services. Before beginning his doctoral studies, Lucky earned a master's degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Connecticut, USA. As a fun fact, Lucky enjoys the outdoors, mainly hiking, running, and socializing with family and friends.
