bio: Elise was a MSc student, where her research focused on using remote sensing at the regional level and forest dynamic plots at the site level to find what constitutes a savanna, and how the savanna-forest paradigm maps on to SE Asian vegetation dynamics.

Elise is broadly interested in studying how shifts in climate and disturbance shape forest boundaries globally. Her project explored what constitutes a savanna, and how the savanna-forest paradigm maps on to SE Asian vegetation dynamics. Her research approaches include both remote sensing at the regional level and forest dynamic plots at the site level. At the University of Washington (BSc), She worked as an undergraduate researcher and field technician, studying forest ecology throughout the region. Consequently, She grew very fond of picking wild blueberries and hiking through stands of red cedars.
