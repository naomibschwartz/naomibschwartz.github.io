Sabrina is an undergraduate student who has been a Research Assistant for the past two summers at the Schwartz Lab. Growing up in Malaysia, she thinks a lot about tropical rainforests and how they change. In her spare time, you can find her crafting, climbing, coffee-making, and breaking patterns of alliteration.
