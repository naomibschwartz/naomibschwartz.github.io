Ben was a 4th year undergraduate student in the Geographical Sciences program, with a special interest in ecology and forest dynamics. In the Schwartz lab, he is using spaceborne LiDAR data (GEDI) to assess the impacts of neighbouring vegetation on edge effects in Amazonian old growth. He grew up in interior BC, and loves to be outside hiking, biking, and climbing.
