We were thrilled to host Dr. Jess Rickenback, from the University of Edinburgh, on a short visit. Dr. Rickenback introduced us to her work using phylogenetics, evolution, and ecology to understand the biogeography and diversity of the ground layer in Southeast Asian savannas, and she gave an excellent talk in the department!
