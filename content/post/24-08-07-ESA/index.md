The Schwartz lab was at ESA 2024. Naomi organized a symposium on "Reconciling Carbon Sequestration, Biodiversity Conservation, and Multiple Land Uses in Tropical Grassy Ecosystems," and lab MSc student Mia Fajeau gave an excellent talk on her work using terrestrial laser scanning to understand impacts of fire suppression in Southeast Asian savannas.
