abstract: Wildfires and subsequent succession regulate the composition of forests across western North America. Due to the heterogeneous nature of fire spread, unburned patches of forests, known as fire refugia, may remain once a fire burns across the landscape. Fire refugia promote forest recovery, where small fire refugia patches are especially important. The ecological impacts of fire refugia are well documented from a field-based perspective. However, research on spatial fire refugia patterns is constrained by high-resolution remote sensing data availability, resulting in limited insight into the ecological role of fire refugia at broad landscape scales. Using Landsat Best Available Pixel composites in the Montane Cordillera ecozone of western Canada, we examined 1) the viability of using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) to detect fire refugia patterns and 2) the relationship between fire refugia distribution and forest regeneration at the Landsat data resolution of 30 meters. We found our SMA outputs performed equally well against Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) at quantifying fine-scale fire refugia distribution, which we classified using 5-meter RapidEye Ortho Tile imagery. We also detected a weak linear relationship between fire refugia distribution and forest regeneration five years after the fire. Our results provide a framework for applying SMA via cloud computing to quantify fire refugia over the Montane Cordillera ecozone. Furthermore, the SMA outputs may allow better spatial insights into the ecological role of fire refugia.
